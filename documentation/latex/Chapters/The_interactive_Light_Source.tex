The previously mentioned light source for the scenario is built around a 12V powered RGB \ac{LED} strip with approximately XX \ac{LED}s. The original controller box which included an \ac{IR} receiver for a remote was taken off and replaced by an Arduino Uno with a custom shield featuring a Roving Networks RN42 Bluetooth module. The whole setup is powered by a standard 12V an Arduino-controlled LED strip. Communication with the bracelet will take place via Bluetooth. The RN42 module implements the Bluetooth \ac{SPP} and can be accessed easily with the \texttt{SoftwareSerial} module from the Arduino standard library. For a color change, the RGB color code is transmitted in a 9-digit string composed of three values from $000$ to $255$. Note that all values must have three digits, leading zeros must not be omitted. Those color values are transmitted directly to the red, green, and blue channels of the \ac{LED} strip, a simple fading algorithm prevents disruptive flashing when switching colors.
