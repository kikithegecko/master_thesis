\chapter{Interaction}

This chapter describes the various interaction levels with the bracelet in detail and illustrates the respective algorithms.

The most casual form of interaction with the bracelet is by drawing gestures in the air to trigger basic operations, e.g. switching a light source on or off. These gestures are recorded by the bracelet's accelerometer and processed using the ``3\$ Gesture Recognizer'' \cite{Kratz2010}, an extension of the popular ``1\$ Recognizer'' by Wobbrock et. al \cite{Wobbrock2007}.
