### Casual Interation with a Bracelet

Yes, this is my Master thesis. It is about interaction with
a wrist-worn wearable (aka bracelet) and encompassed the
whole design and manufacturing process from the bracelet
itself to the needed electronics, some minituarization steps,
and of course the software. Oh, and the writing.

Here are some buzzwords if you're interested but want to know
if looking through all those files is really worth it ;)

- CAD models for 3D printing
- CAD models for liquid silicone cast
- PCB schematics for Teensy and Arduino shields
- Embedded code for a Bluetooth-controlled RGB light source
- A working implementation of the [3$ Gesture Recognizer](http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/pubdb/publications/pub/kratz2010threedollar/kratz2010threedollar.pdf) featuring 3-dimensional Golden Section Search
- A huge LaTeX writeup with lots of progress pictures
- Some slide sets to be used with reveal.js
